# Automatic-Light-using-Blynk-IOT-app
Application of IOT in real life
In this project we learn how to make IoT Based Home Automation Project using Blynk & NodeMCU ESP8266. One of the most common & popular hobby projects you will come across the internet is Smart Home Automation Project. By Home Automation we mean controlling lighting, climate, entertainment systems, and appliances without a manual switch. It may also include home security such as access control and alarm systems. When connected with the Internet, home devices are an important constituent of the Internet of Things (“IoT”).
In this Home Automation System, we will control one light as connected to Relay using Blynk Application. The Wifi Module NodeMCU ESP8266 will Receive commands from the smartphone wirelessly through the internet. To encode the ON/OFF signal and send it to Server and to ESP8266 Board we need the best IoT Platform. So, we chose Blynk as no other application can be better than this one. This project requires internet connectivity & can’t work without Internet connection.
